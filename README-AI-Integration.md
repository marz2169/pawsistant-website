# Pawsistant AI Integration - VAPI Setup Guide

This document provides comprehensive instructions for setting up the VAPI AI voice assistant integration in your Pawsistant application.

## üéØ Overview

Pawsistant now includes a fully functional AI voice assistant powered by VAPI that can:
- Handle veterinary clinic calls professionally
- Schedule appointments
- Provide general pet care information
- Transfer calls to staff when needed
- Maintain a warm, caring personality

## üöÄ Quick Start

The voice assistant is already configured with demo credentials. To test it:

1. **Start the Development Server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the Application**: 
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Test the Voice Assistant**:
   - Click the animated wave icon in the hero section
   - Allow microphone permissions when prompted
   - Start speaking to "Riley", your AI assistant

## üîß VAPI Configuration

### Current Configuration

The system is pre-configured with these VAPI credentials:
- **Public Key**: `816bcb77-68ff-4079-92a3-dec6b25507b2`
- **Assistant ID**: `878e9782-b20d-4460-872f-f7ba920fd01c`

### Setting Up Your Own VAPI Account

To use your own VAPI account:

1. **Sign up at VAPI**: Visit [vapi.ai](https://vapi.ai) and create an account

2. **Create an Assistant**:
   - Go to your VAPI Dashboard
   - Create a new assistant with these recommended settings:
     - **Model**: GPT-4o Mini (for cost-effectiveness)
     - **Voice**: PlayHT "Jennifer" (professional, warm female voice)
     - **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity/consistency)
     - **Max Tokens**: 150 (concise responses)

3. **Configure the Assistant Personality**:
   Use this system message in your VAPI assistant:
   ```
   You are Riley, a friendly and professional AI assistant for Pawsistant, a veterinary clinic management company.

   Your role:
   - Help veterinary clinic staff and pet owners with appointment scheduling
   - Provide general information about veterinary services
   - Handle basic inquiries professionally and warmly
   - Always sound knowledgeable about pet care while being empathetic

   Personality traits:
   - Warm, caring, and professional
   - Patient and understanding with pet owners' concerns
   - Efficient but never rushed
   - Use gentle, reassuring language
   - Occasionally use appropriate pet-related terms naturally

   Key guidelines:
   - Always greet callers warmly: "Hi! This is Riley from [Clinic Name]. How can I help you and your pet today?"
   - For appointments: Ask for pet's name, owner's name, reason for visit, and preferred timing
   - For emergencies: Provide calm guidance and connect to veterinary staff immediately
   - Never provide specific medical advice - always defer to veterinary professionals
   - Keep responses concise but complete (under 100 words typically)
   - End calls with: "Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

   Remember: You represent a cutting-edge AI solution for veterinary clinics, so be professional while showing the technology's capabilities.
   ```

4. **Update Configuration**:
   Edit `ai-config.js` with your credentials:
   ```javascript
   export const VAPI_CONFIG = {
     publicKey: 'your-vapi-public-key-here',
     assistantId: 'your-assistant-id-here',
     // ... rest of configuration
   };
   ```

## üé® UI Components

### Voice Wave Button
The animated wave button in the hero section triggers the voice call:
- Located in the floating assistant container
- Animated wave bars that respond to hover
- Click to initiate voice call
- Visual feedback during active calls

### Call Interface
Professional call interface with:
- **Header**: Pawsistant branding and close button
- **Body**: Animated avatar with pulse rings
- **Status**: Real-time call status updates
- **Controls**: Mute, End Call, and Volume buttons

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Files
- `ai-config.js` - VAPI configuration and settings
- `main.js` - JavaScript integration logic
- `index.html` - HTML structure with VAPI SDK
- `style.css` - Call interface and button styling

### Key Functions
- `initVAPI()` - Initialize VAPI Web SDK
- `startVoiceCall()` - Start voice assistant call
- `endVoiceCall()` - End active call
- `setupVAPIEventListeners()` - Handle VAPI events
- `updateAudioVisualization()` - Visual feedback during calls

### Event Handling
The system responds to these VAPI events:
- `call-start` - Call begins
- `call-end` - Call terminates
- `speech-start` - User starts speaking
- `speech-end` - User stops speaking
- `message` - Transcript and function calls
- `error` - Error handling
- `volume-level` - Audio visualization

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Microphone Permission Denied**
   - Ensure HTTPS (required for microphone access)
   - Check browser permission settings
   - Look for microphone icon in address bar

2. **VAPI SDK Not Loading**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify CDN accessibility
   - Look for console errors

3. **Assistant Not Responding**
   - Verify VAPI credentials in `ai-config.js`
   - Check VAPI dashboard for assistant status
   - Ensure assistant is published

4. **Call Quality Issues**
   - Test microphone with other applications
   - Check network connection stability
   - Try different browsers

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting `debug: true` in `ai-config.js`:
```javascript
development: {
  debug: true,
  logLevel: 'verbose',
  testMode: false
}
```

## üì± Browser Compatibility

Supported browsers:
- ‚úÖ Chrome 80+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 75+
- ‚úÖ Safari 13+
- ‚úÖ Edge 80+

Requirements:
- HTTPS connection (for microphone access)
- Modern JavaScript support (ES6+)
- WebRTC support

## üîí Security Considerations

- VAPI Public Key is safe to expose client-side
- Assistant ID is required for call routing
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Consider rate limiting for production deployments
- Monitor VAPI usage and costs

## üìä Analytics and Monitoring

VAPI provides built-in analytics for:
- Call volume and duration
- Success/failure rates
- User interaction patterns
- Cost tracking

Access these through your VAPI Dashboard.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Update VAPI credentials in `ai-config.js`
- [ ] Ensure HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] Test voice functionality across browsers
- [ ] Configure error monitoring
- [ ] Set up call analytics
- [ ] Review VAPI billing limits

### Environment Variables (Optional)
For additional security, consider using environment variables:
```javascript
// In production, you might load these from environment
const VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY = process.env.VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY || 'fallback-key';
const VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID = process.env.VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID || 'fallback-id';
```
