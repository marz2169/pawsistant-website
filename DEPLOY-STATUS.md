# 🔧 Quick Fix for pawsistant.me

## What I Just Did ✅

1. **Fixed .gitignore** - Excluded node_modules and build files
2. **Committed essential files** - Only deployment configs and source code  
3. **Pushed to GitHub** - Triggered automated deployment

## Check Deployment Status

### 1. GitHub Actions (Automated Build)
- Go to: https://github.com/marz2169/pawsistant-website/actions
- Look for "Deploy Pawsistant.me" workflow
- Should be running now (takes 2-3 minutes)

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages (If Not Already)
- Go to: https://github.com/marz2169/pawsistant-website/settings/pages
- Source: "Deploy from a branch" → Select "gh-pages" 
- Or Source: "GitHub Actions" (if using the workflow)
- Custom domain: `pawsistant.me` ✅

## Expected Timeline
- **2-3 minutes:** GitHub Action builds and deploys
- **5-10 minutes:** DNS propagation completes
- **Result:** pawsistant.me shows your full website

## If Still Blank After 10 Minutes

### Quick Manual Deploy Option:
```bash
# Build locally and push to gh-pages branch
npm run build
npx gh-pages -d dist -o origin
```

### Alternative: Copy dist/ files to root
```bash
# Copy built files to root for GitHub Pages
cp dist/* . 
git add index.html assets/
git commit -m "Manual deploy to root"
git push
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Domain connected: pawsistant.me  
- ✅ GitHub workflow: Created and running
- ✅ Build ready: Production files generated
- ⏳ Deployment: Should complete in 2-3 minutes

**Check back in 5 minutes - your site should be live! 🚀**
